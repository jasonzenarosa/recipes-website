        <ol>
            <li>Add pork belly and 1/2 cup of water to a pan and turn the heat to medium. Stir often until it the fat renders and meat turns golden brown.</li>
            <li>Drain oil from pan, leaving about 2 tbsp. Push the pork to one side of the pan and add garlic, onion, and ginger to the other.</li>
            <li>Saute for 30 seconds and then stir together with the pork.</li>
            <li>Add the coconut milk, serrano peppers, salt, pepper, and pork/chicken boullion.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Then, add the taro leaves.</li>
            <li>Stir in 1 cup of water. Cover and bring to a boil. Then, reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
            <li>Cover and simmer for 1-1.5 hours until soft and the liquid is reduced in half. Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>Turn heat to medium for about 5 minutes or until the peppers are done and the liquid becomes thicker, stirring frequently to avoid burning the bottom.</li>
            <li>Serve!</li>
        </ol>
